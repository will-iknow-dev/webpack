#Webpack

The webpack-dev-server is a little node.js Express server which uses the webpack-dev-middleware to serve a webpacl bundle. It also has a little runtime which is connected to the server via Sockiet.IO. The server emits information about the complilation state to the client, which reacts to those events. You can choose between different modes, depending on your needs.
